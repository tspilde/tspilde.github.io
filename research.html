                    <li>Do Firearm Ordinances Save Lives? An Empirical Analysis of U.S. Municipal Gun Laws</li>
		  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> I present a novel dataset of the universe of municipal gun ordinances between 2008 and 2019 to estimate the effects of gun ordinances on firearm fatalities. I use a 2SLS identification approach to find no discernible effect of ordinances on firearm deaths at the county level. These estimates are tightly bound to zero, so I can rule out large effects. State preemption prevents most municipalities from passing or enforcing laws, which may be a driving force of the null results. I present suggestive evidence that effects may be stronger in California where local communities actively combat gun violence.</p>

               		 <p><strong> Abstract: </strong>  A new wave of social service programs aims to build a pathway out of poverty by helping clients define their own goals and then supporting them flexibly and intensively over multiple years to meet those goals. We conduct a randomized controlled trial of one such program. Participants randomly assigned to intensive, holistic, wrap-around services have 10 percentage points higher employment rates after one year compared with a control group offered only help with an immediate need. Most of this effect appears to persist after programming ends. However, we find limited evidence that intensive, holistic services affect areas beyond employment, even when other areas of life are participants' primary goals. We find some evidence that the program works by increasing hopefulness and agency among participants, which may be more useful in supporting labor force participation than in meeting other goals.<p>
